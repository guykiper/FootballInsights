# FootballInsights

FootballInsights is a football data analysis project focused on extracting statistics from the fbref.com website to analyze performance and identify insights. The key goals are to scrape and collect a comprehensive football dataset, perform exploratory analysis to discover interesting patterns, build machine learning models for prediction, and provide interactive visualizations and dashboards.

The scripts extract a diverse set of football statistics across different entities like players, teams, leagues, matches, and events. This covers extensive attributes such as player biographical information, club and league details, granular play-by-play event data, advanced performance metrics, and more. Structuring this data is crucial for analysis.

The methodology follows several key stages including: web scraping the data from source websites programmatically using tools like BeautifulSoup; structuring and storing the data in databases or files; conducting exploratory analysis with libraries like Pandas to find insights; training machine learning models with Scikit-Learn to enable predictions; and visualizing essential findings through interactive dashboards built using Streamlit.
